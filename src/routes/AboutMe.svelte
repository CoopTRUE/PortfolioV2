  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>
    Hello, I'm Cooper!<br /><br />I'm a self-taught full-stack developer based in the Bay Area,
    California. With a knack for creating efficient, responsive, and user-friendly web applications,
    I've been turning my ideas into reality for over six years.<br /><br />My journey began with
    Python, exploring its vast libraries and building full-stack applications. This led me to delve
    into the world of JavaScript and HTML, where I've built applications using Express, Mongoose,
    React, Svelte, Sveltekit, Vite, and more. I've also developed a deep understanding of
    TypeScript, creating completely typesafe applications and gaining a profound knowledge of how
    types interact with each other.
